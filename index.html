    <h1>Paro, Oh Meri Paro❤️</h1>
    <p>
      I recently stumbled upon a side of you that left me speechless — your art. Your sketches, your paintings, the colors you bring to life... they all tell stories I never knew existed. I was honestly in awe. Not just because they look beautiful (they do), but because they reflect the heart and soul of someone truly gifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t know why you stopped painting, sketching, or drawing rangolis. Life gets in the way sometimes, I get it. But I want you to remember this: the world <span class="highlight">needs your art</span>. Your fingers were made to create. Your mind sees beauty in ways others don’t, and that’s something rare — something worth nurturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If even one stroke of your brush or pencil can make someone smile, feel, or wonder — isn’t that something magical? I believe in you. More than that, I believe in your art. I hope this little note reminds you of the joy you once felt while creating, and I hope it nudges you back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No pressure, no deadlines — just you, your imagination, and whatever colors you feel like playing with.
